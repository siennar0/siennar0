## 👋 Hi there, I’m Sienna!

🎓 I’m currently a Computer Science student at Oregon State University, transitioning from a professional background as a Registered Veterinary Technologist.

💻 I love building user-focused applications that blend logic and empathy — from desktop tools to full-stack web apps.
